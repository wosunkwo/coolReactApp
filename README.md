# Debug Build Configs

## Config One: 
Removed the "-" from my s3 bucket name
Had issues with code pipeline running "npm run build". Fixed that by manually moving my package.json and packagelock.json a folder up from where they were before

## Config Three
- Having issues connecting to GH
![File Three](./assets/aws3-error.png)

- Build errors after fixing GH issues
